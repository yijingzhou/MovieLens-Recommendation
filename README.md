# MovieLens-Recommendation
Final Project for CSCI-SHU 235 Information Visualization

For this project, we present a movie visualization system from data exploration to movie recommendation. After conducting data analysis, we build a system to visualize: 
1)background of the user group; 
2)movie data overview and statistics based on different genres, genders, user occupations;
3)movie recommendation system built upon collaborative filtering recommendation methodology. 

Through visualization, the study provides a deep understanding of the movie industry and implements the simple recommendation principle behind big movie sites like Netflix.
